# nanorobots
This project involved the process of illuminating nanorobots in the field of view of a spatial light modulator (SLM) using a laser 🚨 and microscope 🔬. 

There are three components to this project:
1. Investigating the Gerchberg-Saxton Algorithm for the retrieval of phase information from intensity measurements and enabling the patterning of laser light.
2. Using Computer Vision (OpenCV package) to identity nanorobots.
3. Fix alignment issues between the DSLR and SLM frame to shine light precisely on the nanorobots.

Slideshow files are also available to illustate the three components. 👩‍🔬
